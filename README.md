# @cheesebit/logical

I have always been fascinated by the simplicity of logical operations and how complex logical structures you can build with it.

That's why I wrote this library, to provides a toolset to perform logical operations.

It follows Javascript's default [_truthy_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) and [_falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy)_ definitions.


## Instalation

You can add this hook as a dependency by running `npm install @cheesebit/logical` or `yarn add @cheesebit/logical`.

## Supported operations

## Usage guide

```js
  import logical, { and, or, xor, not, nand, nor, xnor } from '@cheesebit/logical';

```
